    <strong>Insect Biome Atlas (IBA)</strong><br /><br />
    <p><a href="https://www.insectbiomeatlas.com">Insect Biome
Atlas (IBA)</a> is an international collaborative effort to describe in
detail the insect faunas of two biologically and geologically very
different countries: Sweden and Madagascar. The project, one of the
largest ongoing insect biodiversity surveys, addresses key questions
about the insect diversity: How are insect species distributed across
habitats, sites and seasons? What are the key environmental factors
shaping insect diversity?</p>

<p>Collection phase lasted a whole year (2019) in each country and was
done by means of Malaise traps: 200 in Sweden and 50 in
Madagascar. Summing up, the IBA collected more than 8000 insect
community samples. Several other types of samples and ecological
measurements were also collected at the trap sites to gather a full
understanding of the ecological roles of the organisms that comprise
the insect biome in these countries. Analysis of the samples include
identification of all insects and the organisms they interact with,
such as pathogens as well as symbiotic fungi and bacteria - this is
achieved by using novel DNA techniques. The results and material
collected during the IBA project will be useful for scientists
interested in systematics, taxonomy and insect ecology and evolution
for many years to come.</p>

<p>In Sweden the Malaise traps were managed by over 100 volunteers, which
makes this project one of the largest citizen science projects to take
place in Scandinavia.</p>

    <strong>Cynipoid Phylogenomics</strong><br /><br />
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/eggs.JPG" alt="wasp phylogeny" width="500" />
    <p>
      We study gall-wasps to try to understand the genetic basis of their biology. Gall-wasps (or Cynipids) are a family of parasitic wasps that attack oaks and other plants. They are notable for their habit of manipulating their host by forcing it to produce a complex structure where the larvae are fed and protected. However, some cynipids are unable to initiate the process and usually live in the gall of other insects (they are hence termed the "inquilines"). In order to identify genes responsible for gall-induction and clarify its exact mechanism, we compare the genomes of gall-inducers and inquilines. We also work on improving our understanding of both the phylogeny of the group and the life-history of the various species, as this kind of knowledge is essential to the form.

    <strong>Dipteran taxonomy and morphology</strong>
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/megaselia-hansonix.jpg" alt="Megaselia hansonix" width="500" />
    <p>
      Our projects are centered on exploration of the large, "open-ended" genus Megaselia (Diptera: Phoridae). Large, diverse groups like Megaselia can be excellent tools for investigating ecosystems but the sheer size and diversity of these groups pose a number of logistic challenges. Projects will focus on the identification of Megaselia in Sweden (including the description of species new to science), the phylogeny of Megaselia, streamlining species discovery using massive parallel sequencing (MPS), and recovering life history data of the clade using MPS.

    <h2>Metabarcoding of insects for accelerated taxonomic discovery</h2>
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/MTsample.jpg" alt="metabarcoding" width="400"/>
    <p>
      This project, part of the European
      project <a href="http://big4-project.eu">BIG4 consortium</a>
      (Horizon 2020 framework - Marie Curie innovative training
      network), was focused on the optimization of protocols for
      metabarcoding of insects from bulk samples or environmental DNA
      (eDNA).  <br /> <br > Our research stressed the importance of
      the marker choice as one of the key factors in the metabarcoding
      workflow, in terms of maximising taxonomic coverage and
      resolution, as well as which marker is more adequate for
      different types of samples.  <br /> <br > We also focused on
      laboratory methods for non-destructive DNA extraction, trying to
      find the best protocol that effectively extracts DNA while
      minimizing the effect on the structural integrity of the
      specimens, so that their morphology can be examined by
      taxonomists after obtaining the sequencing results.
      <br /> <br > This synergy between metabarcoding and taxonomy can
      speed up the discovery and description of new species.

    <h2>Probabilistic modelling of morphological evolution</h2>
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/morphology-model.png" alt="modeling" width="500" />
    <p>
      Morphology represents an important source of data for understanding evolutionary history, particularly for fossil taxa, which remain the only means by which we can directly observe the history of life. Modern statistical phylogenetic inference methods using Bayesian and maximum likelihood frameworks require probabilistic models of evolution, such as the Generalized Time-Reversible (GTR) model of DNA evolution. However, existing probabilistic models of morphological evolution are relatively simple, and fail to capture the complexity of morphological evolution â€“ in the context of phylogenetic inference, their use is analogous to using only the Jukes-Cantor model for phylogenetic inference using nucleotide data. We are thus developing new probabilistic models of morphological evolution to address this gap. In particular, we are modelling correlation between traits, using both discrete-state continuous-time Markov models and multivariate normal models to detect correlation structure in phenomic datasets.

    <h2>Evolution of butterfly-plant associations</h2>
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/host-parasite.jpg" alt="wasp phylogeny" width="500" />
    <p>
      In collaboration with Michael Landis (Yale University), we are developing a Bayesian approach for inferring the history of association between butterflies and their host plants. We describe the evolution of the repertoire of hosts that a butterfly uses as a continuous-time Markov process of gain and loss of discrete hosts, where gains are influenced by the phylogenetic distance between hosts. This method will allow us to investigate more realistic problems that involve ecological interactions among many taxa.

    <h2>Semantic Knowledge Bases for Biodiversity</h2>
    <img class="image portrait" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/knowledge-base.png" alt="Semantic knowledge bases" width="500" />
    <p>
      A knowledge base (KB) about biodiversity called <a href="http://openbiodiv.net" target="_blank">OpenBiodiv</a>. The KB consists of semantic apps (expert apps) that answer specific questions that biodiversity scientists have, as well as general access services running on top of a semantic graph database. The database is powered by the OpenBiodiv Ontology <http://openbiodiv.net/openbiodivo-20171103> and populated by information extracted from scholarly articles.
