					<h2>Welcome!</h2>
					<p>
						We are interested in Bayesian analyses of problems in systematics, biodiversity and evolutionary biology.
						By combining the development of new algorithms and methodological approaches with empirical research, we seek
						to better understand evolutionary patterns and processes and insect systematics. Our work spans a wide sprectrum
						of topics and techniques, including computational biology, image analysis, phylogenomics, metabarcoding, insect
						biodiversity, and insect taxonomy. We also work on methods and software development, including several software
						packages for Bayesian phylogenetic inference (i.e., MrBayes, RevBayes and the Rev language).
