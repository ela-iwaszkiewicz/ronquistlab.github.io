  <div class="container">

    <p>The Ronquist lab is a highly interactive and interdisciplinary environment, where we focus on innovative research at the interface between statistics, computer science, evolutionary biology, and insect diversity research. We have co-authored some of the leading software packages for Bayesian analysis of phylogenetic problems, and continue to develop new computational approaches, models and inference strategies. Our empirical research is focused on insect diversity and evolution, where we also like to explore new directions. Recent examples include deep learning for automated image-based identification, improved methods for finding genes linked to life-history changes, more efficient molecular techniques for rapid species discovery, and genetic analyses that scale so that we can analyze the composition and function of entire insect faunas and their associated microbiomes.</p>

    <p><strong>2019 Publisher's Award for Excellence in Systematic Research Awarded to Miroslav</strong><br />
      2020-11-16
      <br /><br />
      We are proud to announce that Miroslav Valan, one of the PhD students in the lab, was one of two winners of the <a href="https://www.systbio.org/publishers-award.html">2019 Publisher’s Award for Excellence in Systematic Research</a>. The award is presented to the two best papers based on student research published in Systematic Biology during the previous year. The lead author must have been a student at the time the research was conducted. Miroslav won the prize for his <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/6/876/5368535">paper developing methods</a> for automated image-based identification of insects based on convolutional neural networks and feature transfer.</p>

    <p><strong>Hakuna Ma-Data Microsoft Sponsored Competion Won by Miroslav</strong><br />
      2020-11-16
      <br /><br />

      Miroslav Valan, one of the PhD students in the Ronquist lab, recently won the <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/59/camera-trap-serengeti/">Hakuna Ma-Data</a> competition sponsored by Microsoft. The task was to automatically identify species of wildlife in camera trap images from the Serengeti National Park. His contribution placed first among contributions from over 800 teams, earning him a $20,000 contribution to his research. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07828">Miroslav’s solution</a> was presented at the prestigious computer-vision conference CVPR 2020.</p>
