        <h1><strong>Two postdoctoral researchers in applied statistics / quantitatve ecology</strong></h1>
        <p> In the <a href="https://insectbiomeatlas.org">Insect Biome Atlas</a> project, we characterize the insect faunas of Sweden and Madagascar using metabarcoding of thousands of Malaise trap and soil samples. The aim is to study the size, origins, structure and function of the insect biomes and their associated microbiomes. The density of sampling in these inventories is unprecedented.

        We are now looking for two postdocs in applied statistics / quantitative ecology to analyze the unique data generated in the project. One of the postdocs will be expected to apply joint species distribution modelling to analyze the spatial and temporal drivers of species distributions and community patterns. The postdoc will then be expexpected to develop data-informed, optimal solutions for genetically based monitoring of insect faunas. Applicants for this position should have a strong background in applied statistics and quantitative ecology. The other postdoc will be expected to analyze the phenology, composition and distribution of insect communities, and then relate community structure to ecosystem functions measured at the sampled localities. Applicants for this position should have a strong background in quantitative community ecology.

        <h1><strong>Postdoc in probabilistic programming</strong></h1>
        <p> We are looking for a postdoc interested in developing new modeling and inference tools based on universal probabilistic programming, an approach that has attracted considerable attention across scientific disciplines in recent years. Specifically, we will be developing a domain-specific language to describe phylogenetics problems, TreePPL, and design new inference strategies for such model descriptions. The goal is to successfully tackle some of the most challenging research problems in statistical phylogenetics and phylogenomics. For some early success stories, see our recent <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.154443">paper on bioRxiv</a>. The postdoc will be encouraged to develop new projects, apply for third-party funding, supervise students and lecture at courses.
